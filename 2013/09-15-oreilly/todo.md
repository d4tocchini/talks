# CSS Layout is Broken

Web Designers ....
translate intentions into 
can't align two elements

# What good web designers do

# Feed-based layouts on Facebook, Pinterest, etc. not good enough

# Using AI to Scale Good Design

- On the Grid, sites design themselves to adapt the content, "content dictates form." This is accomplished using Constraint Solvers.
- Constraint Programming is a paradigm that originated in AI in the 1970s, and more recently, has leveraged as the secret sauce in Search & Machine Learning.

Sites on the Grid are powered by several Constraint Solvers 


We are not trying to eliminate designers, we are building tools to enable them to scale.  

Designers on the Grid platform are given a high level language to describe their layouts using constraints or rules, as a user adds content, the Grid calculates a feasible layout that satisfies the given constraints.  This is accomplished by coordinating several "Constraint Solvers".

Constraint Programming is a paradigm that originated in AI in the 1970s, and more recently has been used as the secret sauce in Search & Machine Learning. 

"Constraint Programming is the holy grail of "

We are committed to serious innovation in scaling design of stream-based layouts.


# Cassowary Linear Arithmetic Constraint Solver

- Greg Badros, a decade
- Dan Tocchini, founder of the Grid fixed it for the web
- Apple
- Layout
- First to bring it to the web

# Platform Technology: GSS

- Cassowary is too low-level & complex to be useful, so we created a Layout Programming Language and added it to CSS.  We call it GSS, or Grid Style Sheets.   
- GSS is slated for launch in Oct 2013

# GSS Demo


# MVC Frameworks are not enough


# Flow-Based Programming

# Why hasn't FBP taken off?

- IT HAS!

# Platform Technology: The Flo

- Developers on the Grid platform are given a visual data environment, not just a data API.  
- The Flo is a visual development environment
- The Grid was built wit it

# On the Grid, hackers can Pull back the hood & hack on the graph

# Designer Platform Technology

- The lanaguage didn't exist to describe auto-designing layouts
- So, we created 3 new layout languages and added it to CSS
- That harness

Major additions:

Competitive Landscape: Make another graphic to show how we're insulated from competition

Add slides for Platform Technology Tools, mention patent, benefit to designers & developers

Add slide for Customer Acquisition Plan: TheGrid crowd-presales campaign, beautifully auto-generated websites for events (e.g. SXSW), hub/spoke publishing, 

Redesign the markeft segmentation chart

Add more customer value props?


Minor additions:

Graphic that more clearly demos the arrow key functionality

Full-Screen bg videos



benefit of the designer (and for that matter dev tools)
 

 
more customer benefits (e.g. more customers for less work)... value prop slide might be the place for this

what's the job to be done by which i need a home on the internet?

Market: C, 1 of 3 are actual job to be done, the other are too product specific... "website problem" is a decent job to by done (missing the why? always on store front?)... "financial transactions" is not a job to be done, "leveraging personal and extended network to drive revenue" is a job to be done... "apps as sites" is not a job to be done - "bringing customers back to my storefront" is a job to be done...

Customer Acquisition: F missing... items to include: TheGrid crowd-presales campaign, beautifully auto-generated websites for events (e.g. SXSW), hub/spoke publishing, 

Fundraising: C, didn't include selling 15%-20% of company for $3M... reasonable given noflo traction, team, etc... not too crazy of an ask...
